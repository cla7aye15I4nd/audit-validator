/**
 * @title FNDRGovernance
 * @dev A comprehensive governance contract for Fundtir token holders with integrated staking and vesting support
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Proposal creation with configurable threshold (default: 0.25% of total supply)
 * - One wallet, one vote system with minimum voting weight requirement
 * - Dynamic quorum requirements (admin-configurable)
 * - Integration with staking and vesting contracts for voting power calculation
 * - Snapshot-based voting with fallback to current balances
 * - Manual execution via executor (typically multisig)
 * 
 * Governance Parameters:
 * - Proposer threshold: 0.25% of total supply (staked + vested amount combined)
 * - Quorum: Dynamic admin-set number of votes required
 * - Voting options: For / Against / Abstain
 * - Voting power: One wallet, one vote (with minimum voting weight requirement)
 * - Execution: Manual via executor (e.g., multisig)
 * 
 * Integration:
 * - FNDR ERC20 token for total supply calculations
 * - Staking contract for staked token amounts (with historic snapshot support)
 * - Vesting contract for unclaimed vested amounts
